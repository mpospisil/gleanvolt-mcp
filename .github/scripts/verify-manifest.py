"""Assert a published manifest list covers every platform, Windows included, with its build number.

Reads `docker buildx imagetools inspect --raw` output on stdin and exits non-zero if anything is
missing. It exists because both failures it checks for are invisible in a green workflow run: an
index that silently lost a platform still pushes, and a Windows entry with no `os.version` is a
well-formed manifest that Windows hosts simply cannot match.
